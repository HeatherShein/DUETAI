## General info

DUET Replica using Unity with an AI playing the game.

DUET is a mobile game in which the player controls two balls that are linked to each other. 
The goal is to avoid obstacles by rotating the two balls together.
This project re-implemented DUET using Unity, offers a simple level based game for regular players and has an AI section with two different approaches.

## Technologies

This project was created using:

* Unity 2019.4.17f1
* Unity ML-Agents 1.0

## AI Solving

There were two different ways of solving the problem that were implemented :

* One with Unity ML-Agents 1.0 that trains a neural network to then play the game.
* One using a genetic algorithm.
